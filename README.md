### Overview

During the Covid-19 crisis, people have been forced into isolation for many months. With the lockdown measures  now relaxing, it is as important as ever for us to get out of the house and allow natural socialising to resume in a responsible manner. 

---

### Description

The Explore Ireland Project is dedicated to providing a free platform for all interested in road trips, exploring and camping to join us on breath-taking drives around the Irish countryside. Our trips are expertly planned and researched to ensure a safe, enjoyable and healthy experience. 

---
#### User Stories

- *"I want to be able to subscribe to a mailing list about upcoming trips"*
- *"I want to get in touch immediately as I have some recommendations on future routes"*
- *"We are keen to get involved but would love to see visual examples of past trips to give us an idea of what to expect"*

### UX

This website project will target a large demographic of individuals and families from all walks of life. 

---

#### 1.	Strategy

>  The aim of this project is to grow awareness and community engagement, hence keeping the UX simple and user-friendly and leading users to contact via email and/or join our Facebook community Page.
>
>  ##### Project Goals:
>
>  - Raising awareness on the important connecting and appreciating our environment.
>
>  - Building on community awareness of the natural beauty that Ireland has to offer.
>
>  - Growing member database via email and direction to Facebook Group interactivity
>
>  ##### Customer Goals:
>
>  - Easy-to-read info. Long enough to understand the content, yet short enough not to overwhelm.>
>  - Imagery used for intuitive explanation of trips and showing inviting scenery.
>  - Simple point of contact form 
>  - Strong contrasting social media icons in main navigation bar, and footer. 
>  - Fixed navigation bar allowing user quick navigation reference.

#### 2.	Scope

>  I've decided on an MVP (Minimal Viable Product) approach, which:
>
>  - Fits in with my current skill-set
>  - Provides a clean UX for users
>  - Quickly defines the content and focus on getting in touch
>  - In addition to this, I've included some **basic** animations in line with my time, skill and resources to subtly enhance the overall experience.

#### 3.	Structure

> The main focus in my structure is to allow Users to quickly assimilate the information and imagery. I've used short, focussed paragraphs of content information to provide enough information, yet not overwhelm. 
>
> Points of contact are provided via email contact form, link to the Facebook Page (in footer and navigation bar) and a downloadable registration form.

#### 4.	Skeleton Surface

> - Wireframe: One-page website with **4** main sections															
>
> - Fixed navigation bar - Menu headings pointing to each of the 5 sections (pages)
>
> - Footer with centred Social Media icons

---

**TO COMPLETE---->** (links to any **wireframes, mockups, diagrams** 

---

#### 5. 	Surface

I've decided on a relaxed, yet exciting visual experience reflecting nature and peacefulness coupled with exhilaration of more extreme 4x4 routes and breath-taking views. 

> ###### Colours 
>
> Neutral soft-tones, reflecting the environment, inviting the User 'outdoors'. including browns and greens in soft tones while maintaining contrast with text on white background.

> ###### Typography
>
> "Varela" font for main headings and "Cabin" font for body content. I've included sans-serif as a fallback font for both.

>  ###### Animations
>
>  Due to limitation on skill, yet desirability of having some interactivity, I've included simple hover functions on Social Media button in the navigation, and an auto-scrolling carousel for images.

>  ###### Images
>
>  The image selection has been carefully chosen to depict both relaxed road trips for beginners (to instil confidence in taking part as a newcomer); and more extreme 4x4 experiences for the advanced, familiar user.

---

### Testing

> - After initial wireframe design, I checked each navigation item link is working correctly to each Page. I set a *temporary* contrasting background colour to each page to mark out each section.
> - Tested responsiveness of the wireframe using Dev Tools and confirmed basic structure looks and works well on all mobile decides from 320px, up to desktop size.

---

### Project barriers and the solutions

> - Bootstrap carousel works fine on desktop views with landscape images, but on mobile created large white space underneath. I overcame this by centering the carousel on mobile devices, and giving it a soft background in line with colour palette.
